# Word-Cloud
A project for Data Structures with Layla Oesper at Carleton College. 

Implemented a binary search tree to count words and
their counts in movie or TV show scripts.


Designed different traversals of tree to output word clouds in a HTML file and word counts by frequency or alphabetical order to find the most common words used in movies or TV shows.

# How to 

To display only the words and their respective counts, the filename of the text file should be the only argument.

To create a word cloud based on the desired text file, the first argument should be the name of the text file, the second should be the number of words to be displayed in the cloud, and the third should be file name which the word cloud HTML will be saved to.
